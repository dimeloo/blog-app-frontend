                    Human beings are storytellers. This basic, constant instinct is evident throughout history â€” from creation narratives told around the night's fire to Greek playwrights to the first novels to the flickering images of early motion pictures. What has changed, though, is how we tell stories. Each of our technologies, from the printing press to celluloid film, has opened up revolutionary new possibilities that have fundamentally altered the way stories can be told. That revolutionary role of technology is at work again now, and it's why we should be paying attention to video games. Yes, video games.
